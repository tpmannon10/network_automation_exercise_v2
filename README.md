# Python Coding Exercise for Network Automation Engineer

Problem Statement:

Your company is implementing a Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) solution for network devices. The goal is to automate the process of downloading, parsing, and deploying configuration files to networking hardware (e.g., routers, switches, Wi-Fi access points). As a Network Automation Engineer, you are tasked with developing a Python script that simulates this process.

Task Description:

Fetch Configuration Files from a Cloud Server: • Write a function that makes an API call to a simulated cloud server to fetch network configuration files. Assume the API returns JSON-formatted configuration data. • For this exercise, you can simulate the API response by reading a local JSON file that contains various network settings (DHCP, DNS, VLAN, etc.).
Parse the Configuration File: • Develop a function that parses the JSON data to extract various network settings, such as: • DHCP reservations • DNS settings • VLAN configurations • Firewall and ACL settings • IP assignments and routing
Organize Network Configurations: • Create a Python class NetworkConfig that holds the parsed configurations and provides methods to display or modify them. This class should handle different network settings logically and allow easy retrieval and modification.
Simulate Deployment to Network Devices: • Write a function deploy_configuration that takes the NetworkConfig object and simulates deploying these settings to different types of network devices (router, switch, access point). Since there is no access to actual devices, the function should output a log of deployment steps, indicating success or failure.
Error Handling and Validation: • Ensure proper error handling for scenarios such as API call failures, missing configuration sections, or incorrect data types. • Validate the configurations to ensure they meet certain criteria (e.g., valid IP address format, non-overlapping VLANs, etc.).
Documentation and Code Quality: • Provide clear documentation within the code, including docstrings for all functions and methods. • Ensure the code is modular, readable, and follows best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
Expected Output:

• Properly parsed and organized network configurations. • Simulated deployment logs that clearly state what configurations are being applied and where. • Error handling scenarios demonstrated (e.g., missing configuration data).

Evaluation Criteria:

• Correctness of the code. • Ability to parse and manage data efficiently. • Understanding of network settings and configurations. • Code quality, readability, and documentation. • Handling edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.

Instructions:

• Provide your Python code solution in a single file. • Ensure all dependencies, if any, are clearly stated.
